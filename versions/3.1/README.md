# About the project

`@ts-stack/open-api-spec` is [OpenAPI Specification][1] v3.1 writen in TypeScript.
To use it, required TypeScript v4.1+.

Major and minor versions of `@ts-stack/open-api-spec` are the same as [OpenAPI Specification][1],
but the patch version is not the same. Check the patch version here (in the README).

## Introduction

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs
which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service
without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly
defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of
implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code
generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools,
and many other use cases.

## Install

```bash
npm i @ts-stack/open-api-spec
